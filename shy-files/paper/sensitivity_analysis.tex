\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

To assess the robustness of our LSTM model, we varied two key input variables—HHI and historical performance—by $\pm5\%$ (and $\pm10\%$ for HHI) to observe their impact on predicted medal counts.

As illustrated by the purple bar charts, modest ($\pm5\%$) changes in either HHI or historical performance produced only slight variations in the total predicted medals, indicating that the model’s estimates remain relatively stable despite these perturbations.

The line plot further confirms this stability: while $+10\%$ or $-10\%$ adjustments to HHI do shift the prediction curves, the overall trend and magnitude of predicted medal counts remain consistent. These results suggest our LSTM model is reasonably robust to small fluctuations in these input variables.
